## üßÆ SQL Analysis Highlights

### 1. Top 5 Categories for Launching New Free Apps
```sql
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM playstore
WHERE type = 'free'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 2. Top 3 Categories by Paid App Revenue (price √ó installs)
```sql
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(installs * price), 2) AS revenue
FROM playstore
WHERE type = 'paid'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 3. Game Percentage by Category
```sql
SELECT category,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN genres LIKE '%Game%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(*), 2) AS game_percentage
FROM playstore
GROUP BY category;
```

### 4. Average Rating and Total Installs (Free vs Paid)
```sql
SELECT type, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating, SUM(installs) AS total_installs
FROM playstore
WHERE rating IS NOT NULL AND installs IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY type;
```

### 5. Highest Reviewed App in Each Category
```sql
SELECT category, app, MAX(reviews) AS max_reviews
FROM playstore
GROUP BY category;
```

### 6. Underrated Apps (High Reviews, Low Rating)
```sql
SELECT app, rating, reviews
FROM playstore
WHERE rating < 3.5 AND reviews > 50000
ORDER BY reviews DESC;
```

### 7. Top 5 Categories with Most High-Rated Apps (‚â• 4.5)
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS high_rated_apps
FROM playstore
WHERE rating >= 4.5
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY high_rated_apps DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 8. Most Common Genres
```sql
SELECT genres, COUNT(*) AS app_count
FROM playstore
GROUP BY genres
ORDER BY app_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 9. Most Installed Apps by Category
```sql
SELECT category, app, MAX(installs) AS max_installs
FROM playstore
GROUP BY category, app
ORDER BY max_installs DESC;
```

### 10. Recommendation: Free or Paid App by Category
```sql
WITH paid_avg AS (
  SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_paid
  FROM playstore
  WHERE type = 'paid'
  GROUP BY category
),
free_avg AS (
  SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_free
  FROM playstore
  WHERE type = 'free'
  GROUP BY category
)
SELECT paid_avg.category, avg_paid, avg_free,
       CASE WHEN avg_paid > avg_free THEN 'Develop Paid Apps'
            ELSE 'Develop Free Apps' END AS recommendation
FROM paid_avg
JOIN free_avg ON paid_avg.category = free_avg.category;
```
